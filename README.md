# keyboards

This repo contains PCBs, schematics, and [ZMK](https://zmk.dev) firmware configurations for the keyboards I built and used.

## corne36w
- Based on the [Corne by foostan](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd)
- Uses Choc swtich spacing and Nice!Nano footprint edits by [davidphilipbarr](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Choc-Spaced-Corne)
- Customised traces and silkscreen
- Firmware based mostly on [dxmh's configs](https://github.com/dxmh/zmk-config)
